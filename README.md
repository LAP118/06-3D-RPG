# 06-3D-RPG
A repository for a 3D RPG that would have been made in Godot for the class C220 Game Technology at Indiana University. 

## Implementation
Jason Francis said that we could get full credit for just turning in a README and a license so that's what I did.

## References
I have no references as there is no project.

## Future Development
Nope. I will not be working on this. I have to study for finals.
